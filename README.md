For Professor Tamar Shinar's CS130 class: Computer Graphics 

> https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~shinar/courses/cs130/proj-rt.html

## Overview

For this project, a basic ray tracer was implemented.  Images of the expected results are stored in the images directory, 
while test files with tests pertaining to each image are stored in the txt directory.

## To Run:
To run specific tests, do `./ray_tracer -i <test-file>`

To run the grading scripts, do `./grading-script.py .`
